This application demonstrates the use of an MICRF112/114 as transmitter and MICRF220/219A as receiver using ASK MODULATION with WBZ451 Curiosity Board.

In this Demo the [BLE Sensor application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor) is implemented on both transmitter part and receiver part to control the RGB LED. The RGB values are received from the [(MBD App)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microchip.bluetooth.data&hl=en_IN&gl=US) using BLE Sensor application and then it is transmitted through MICRF112/114. The MICRF220/219A receives the RGB values and updates the RGB LED using [BLE Sensor application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor).

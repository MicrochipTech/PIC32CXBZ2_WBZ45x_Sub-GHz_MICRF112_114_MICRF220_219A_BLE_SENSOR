## 1. Introduction<a name="step1">

This application demonstrates the use of an MICRF112/114 as transmitter and MICRF220/219A as receiver using ASK Modulation interfaced with WBZ451 Curiosity Board to control the RGB LED of WBZ451 Curiosity board on receiver part. This LED can be controlled by Microchip Bluetooth Data ([(MBD)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microchip.bluetooth.data&hl=en_IN&gl=US) application through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using [BLE Sensor application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor).The temperature data is also periodically reported to the mobile phone through BLE.

The [BLE Sensor application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor) is implemented on both transmitter part and receiver part to control the RGB LED. The RGB values are received from the (MBD) application using BLE Sensor application and then it is transmitted through MICRF112/114. The MICRF220/219A receives the RGB values and updates the RGB LED using [BLE Sensor application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor).

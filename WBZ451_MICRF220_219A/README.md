## 5. Harmony MCC Configuration<a name="step5">

### Getting started with MICRF220/219A with WBZ451 CURIOSITY BOARD.

| Tip | New users of MPLAB Code Configurator are recommended to go through the [overview](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-1F7007B8-9A46-4D03-AEED-650357BA760D-en-US-6/index.html?GUID-AFAB9227-B10C-4FAE-9785-98474664B50A) |
| :- | :- |

**Step 1** - Connect the WBZ451 CURIOSITY BOARD to the device/system using a micro-USB cable.

**Step 2** - This application is built by using [WBZ45x BLE Sensor with ATTINY3217 Touch Demo](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45x_BLE_SENSOR_Touch_ATtiny3217) as the building block. The project graph of the WBZ45x BLE Sensor with ATTINY3217 Touch Demo application is shown below.

**Step 3** - In MCC harmony project graph add the TC0 and TC1 from device resources->peripherals->TC and configure as shown below.

![](docs/tc0.png)

![](docs/tc1.png)

**Step 4** - In MCC harmony project graph select the Pin Configurations from plugins and configure as shown below.

![](docs/pin.png)

**Step 5** - The project graph after making the configurations is shown below.

![](docs/pg.png)

**Step 6** - [Generate the code](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-A5330D3A-9F51-4A26-B71D-8503A493DF9C-en-US-1/index.html?GUID-9C28F407-4879-4174-9963-2CF34161398E).

| Note: Download or clone the application to do the following steps !! |
| --- |

**Step 7** - From the unzipped folder copy the folder MICRF220_219A from WBZ451_MICRF112_114 to the folder firmware/src under your MPLAB Harmony v3 application project and add the Header (dvr_crc.h, dvr_micrf112.h, transmitter.h) and Source file (dvr_crc.c, dvr_micrf112.c, transmitter.c).

- In the project explorer, Right click on folder Header Files and add a sub folder MICRF220_219A by selecting “Add Existing Items from Folders…”

![](docs/header_add.png)

- Click on “Add Folder…” button.

![](docs/header_add2.png)

- Select the “MICRF220_219A” folder and select “Files of Types” as Header Files.

**Step 9** - In your MPLAB Harmony v3 based application go to "firmware\src\app_ble\app_ble.c" and do the following changes.

- Edit/Replace the folllowing line.

```
#define GAP_DEV_NAME_VALUE          "BLE_SENSOR_MICRF"
```

![](docs/app_ble.png)

- Edit/Replace the folllowing code.

```
BLE_GAP_Addr_T devAddr;
devAddr.addrType = BLE_GAP_ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC;
devAddr.addr[0] = 0x9A;
devAddr.addr[1] = 0x21;
devAddr.addr[2] = 0x78;
devAddr.addr[3] = 0xA6;
devAddr.addr[4] = 0xB7;
devAddr.addr[5] = 0xC8;
```

![](docs/id.png)

**Step 10** - In your MPLAB Harmony v3 based application go to "firmware\src\config\default\peripheral\adchs\plib_adchs.c" and do the following changes.

- Add the header file in the folllowing line.

```
#include "../MICRF220_219A/dvr_adc.h"
```

![](docs/adchs1.png)

- Add the folllowing code.

```
ADCHS_CallbackRegister( ADCHS_CH5, DVR_ADC_isr, (uintptr_t)NULL);
```

**Step 11** - Clean and build the project. To run the project, select "Make and program device" button.


## 6. Board Programming<a name="step6">

## Programming hex file:

### Program the precompiled hex file using MPLAB X IPE

- The Precompiled hex file is given in the hex folder.
Follow the steps provided in the link to [program the precompiled hex file](https://microchipdeveloper.com/ipe:programming-device) using MPLABX IPE to program the pre-compiled hex image. 


### Build and program the application using MPLAB X IDE

The application folder can be found by navigating to the following path: 

- "WBZ451_MICRF220_219A/firmware/WBZ451_MICRF220_219A.X"

Follow the steps provided in the link to [Build and program the application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor#build-and-program-the-application-guid-3d55fb8a-5995-439d-bcd6-deae7e8e78ad-section).

## 7. Run the demo<a name="step7">

- After programming the board, the expected application behavior is shown in the below [video](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45x_Sub-GHz_MICRF112_114_MICRF220_219A_BLE_SENSOR/blob/main/WBZ451_MICRF220_219A/docs/micrf_working.gif).
